# 12VDC Soft Latching Power Switch

What is a Soft Latching Power Switch?

A soft latching switch is a circuit that uses a momentary push button switch to turn a device on and off. It's a safe and elegant way to control a circuit's power, and it's different from a mechanical latching switch, which physically disconnects power.
